# UltimateKalman: Flexible Kalman Filtering and Smoothing Using Orthogonal Transformations

This repository contains the source code of UltimateKalman in three different programming languages: MATLAB, C and Java.

UltimateKalman is documented carefully in an article in the [ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software](https://doi.org/10.1145/3699958). Please cite this article when citing the algorithm or the software. 

The software itself is also archived on Zenodo and is citable. The release that corresponds to the _ACM Tranactions on Mathematical Software article_, release v1.2.0, is available on Zenodo [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14543666.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14543666).
